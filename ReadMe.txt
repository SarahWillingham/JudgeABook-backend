  To discuss: 
  - identify what our application does? 
      backend: list operations for entities like Book and Reader;
               
      
      frontend: what webpages do we need, do we need to have a wireframe to visualize that?
  
  - who's our target audience? 
  - how is our application useful? (what are our highlight features? if any)
  - name of our appllication + team.
